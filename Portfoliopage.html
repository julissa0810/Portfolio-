      <p class= "intro">  When I think of portfolio I think  of the
      academic progress I have made throught the year. I see how different
      my knowledge has changed and how far my potential was able to go at
      the end of the year. I think of projects that can descirbe how hard
      I have worked but can also show how much fun I added into my work.
      I will add some work I really enjoyed doing in my ScriptEd Foundation
      class 2018. </p>

    <li><a href = "https://codepen.io/anon/pen/bONYYv" >Protest finder</a>
    <p> Protest finder was my first website that was created during a hackthon<
    /p>
    <a href = "https://codepen.io/sl1021/pen/oExyxZ">SafeFace project</a>
    <p class = "purpose"> The purose of the protest finder website was to creat a form of
    communcation for people who are apart of the LGBT+ communnity. We wanted
    to build a safe enviornment for those who identify as LGBT+.  We wanted to 
    give help to those who needed advice or guidence on accepting who they are
    and telling their families who they are by those who have already experienced this.

    <p> This project was about experimenting the animation blocks that was provided through Snap!. This was a great project because it gave me
    the ability to briefly explain who I am. I did find this format interesting because I only view computer science as only websites and codes.
    During this project I had new eperiences and understanding what Snap! was. </p>
