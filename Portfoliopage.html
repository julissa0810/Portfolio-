      <p class= "intro">  When I think of portfolio I think  of the
      academic progress I have made throught the year. I see how different
      my knowledge has changed and how far my potential was able to go at
      the end of the year. I think of projects that can descirbe how hard
      I have worked but can also show how much fun I added into my work.
      I will add some work I really enjoyed doing in my ScriptEd Foundation
      class 2018. </p>
      <a href = "https://protest-project.glitch.me/" >Protest finder</a>
    <p> Protest finder was made to make the life of New yorkers easier by
    having a website/app that alerts them when a protest is going to happen. 
    We also added a live feed, in case you are not able to attend a protest, 
    you can still see the event, but going to these protest would also give 
    a couple perks. For example: If you attend a certain amount of protest 
    in your area, you will be given points and those points will eventually 
    turn into some kind of money or coupon and they can possibly be used in 
    Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts to name a few.

    <a href = "https://codepen.io/sl1021/pen/oExyxZ">SafeFace project</a>
    <p> The purose of the SafeFace website was to creat a form of
    communcation for people who are apart of the LGBT+ communnity. We wanted
    to build a safe enviornment for those who identify as LGBT+.  We wanted to 
    give help to those who needed advice or guidence on accepting who they are
    and telling their families who they are by those who have already experienced this.

    <p> This project was about experimenting the animation blocks that was provided 
    through Snap!. This was a great project because it gave me the ability to 
    briefly explain who I am. I did find this format interesting 
    because I only viewed computer science as only websites and codes.
    During this project I had new eperiences and understanding what Snap! was. </p>
    <a href =" https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=julissaj&ProjectName=Lab%201.3">Drawing shapes in Snap! </a>
 <p> Drawing shapes in snap was an interesting project because there was basic math involved,
     there was a lot of extra code that was needed to complete the requirements. In this 
     project I learned how to nest all my code for specific functions to work and I 
     realized that animation and web development have some things in common.
