      <p class= "intro">  When I think of portfolio I think  of the academic progress I have made throught the year. I see how different my knowledge has changed and how far my potential was able to go at the end of the year. I think of projects that can descirbe how hard I have worked but can also show how much fun I added into my work. I will add some work I really enjoyed doing in my ScriptEd Foundation class 2018. </p>
