       <p class= "personal"> I enjoy creating makeuplooks, music and coding.I love the excitment the snare drum gives me when the beat is just right. I value knowledge and communication in relationahips with people who are important to me. </p>
       <p class= "home"> My parents are from Nicaragua(Central America). My two older sibilings were also bored in Nicaragua. In 1996, my mother came to America to have a different life and have a better future. My twin brother and I were born August 10th. We learned to speak our main language, Spanish, and then we learned English in the mix of that.</p>
