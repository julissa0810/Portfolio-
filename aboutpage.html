        <h1> My name is Julissa Juarez. I am 17 years od and a senior in high school. 
        My parents were born and raised in Nicarauga while my twin brother and I were 
        born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. Desrcibing myself is hard because I am so 
        involved with people and I care about other people and forget to think about 
        myself (in a good way). I asked a couple of close friends what comes to mind 
        when they hear my name. They responded with butterflies, rainbows, rays of 
        sunshine, genuine and happiness. I was surprised to hear their responses 
        because I wouldn't have been able to describe myself in such a positive way,
        but these are things I want to keep around me because it is a part of who I
        and who I wil be.</h1>
